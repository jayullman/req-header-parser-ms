# req-header-parser-ms

## User Story Requirements
1. I can get the IP address, language and operating system for my browser.

### About
The goal of this project was to build a simple backend application and deploy to heroku.
The application was built using Express.js and parses out the ipaddress, language, and software 
from the client request and then sends that information back to the client in JSON format.
